# Spring Boot Backend for General Assembly Acpstone Project.

## This project utilizes Spring Boot and PostgreSQL for database which was then deployed to Heroku

#### The goal of the project was to choose a new technology and learn and build something with it in two weeks.

#### I built a CRUD app with React for the Frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. Spring Boot being my new technology.

I quickly learned that Spring Boot is written in Java and is based off the Spring framework. I had no experience with either of those things.

In two weeks I had to learn at least enough Java syntax to do basic Object Oriented Programming and and the same goes for Spring and Spring Boot.

I managed to get the backend built be the end of the first by the start of the second week.

## I learned a lot in this two week project. Later after the cohort was done I went back and learned more Java and Spring Boot fundamentals. Overall this project was a great gateway into both of those technologies.
